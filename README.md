This is a machine learning project which allows us to predict the price of a laptop which fits within the given specifications.

It takes as input values like Brand, Type, Ram, Screen size, etc. and predicts the estimated price of the laptop with these set of features using the Random Forest regression algorithm.

## Random Forest
Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique. It can be used for both Classification and Regression problems in ML. It is based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.

As the name suggests, "Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset." Instead of relying on one decision tree, the random forest takes the prediction from each tree and based on the majority votes of predictions, and it predicts the final output.
